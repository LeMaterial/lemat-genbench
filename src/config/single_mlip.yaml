type: single_mlip

# Single-MLIP configuration for before/after relaxation comparison
# This config is designed for evaluating structures with a SINGLE MLIP only
# Use with run_benchmarks_single_mlip.py

# Key differences from comprehensive config:
# - Uses ONLY ONE MLIP (specified via command line --mlip flag)
# - Evaluates against that specific MLIP's hull (no ensembling)
# - Optimized for before/after relaxation comparison workflow
# - Uses structure-matcher for fast fingerprinting by default

# Validity benchmark settings (always run - mandatory)
validity_settings:
  charge_tolerance: 0.1
  distance_scaling: 0.5
  min_atomic_density: 0.00001
  max_atomic_density: 0.5

description: "Single-MLIP benchmark configuration for before/after relaxation comparison"
version: "1.0.0"
metadata:
  reference: "Single-MLIP evaluation for relaxation effect analysis"
  use_case: "Evaluate structures before and after relaxation with same MLIP"
  workflow:
    - "Run this config on original structures (before relaxation)"
    - "Run relax_structures.py to relax with chosen MLIP"
    - "Run this config again on relaxed structures (after relaxation)"
    - "Compare metrics to analyze relaxation effects"
  notes:
    - "Validity benchmark is ALWAYS run automatically"
    - "Uses structure-matcher for fast fingerprinting by default"
    - "MLIP is specified via --mlip command line argument"
    - "Evaluates against specific MLIP's hull (no ensembling)"
    - "Ideal for before/after relaxation comparison"
